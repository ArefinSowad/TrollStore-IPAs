# TrollStore-IPAs
A collection of IPA files from many different sources, for TrollStore!

All credit to their respective maintainers, I simply gather and update all the IPAs I have in one place

All *future* app updates will contain some form of version numbers in the file names. If the versioning scheme for an app changes, it is because the dev/maintainer changed up their scheme

All files can be found in Releases, either by Ctrl + F searching, or looking at the table to see what date the latest version of an app was released, and finding the corresponding release with a matching date

Releases are made by the day - new day, new release. I make a release one day and edit it throughout the day with new or updated IPAs until the day ends, and then create a new release post by the day and just modify it. This keeps notification spam to a minimum but will mean you might want to wait until the day ends to go through a release to make sure all files are final, since I may make changes throughout the day. Everything is done in the CST time zone

*Since people see TrollStore in the title and immediately think all apps in here are TrollStore only, they aren't. A lot of apps in here will work just fine when sideloaded. However, since I am personally using these apps with TrollStore, I cannot guarantee that every app will work while properly sideloaded, nor will I offer any support if an app from this list doesn't work as intended when sideloaded*

Everything you can currently find in this repo:

| Crunchyroll | Crunchyroll, the app. Yes, just the app. No tweak, no crack, no ad-block, nothing - just a decrypted Crunchyroll app. Why, you ask? Because apparently it's not available in certain other countries and someone requested it, and it works decrypted so I figured I'd throw it on this list. Will probably only update this on request, so create an issue if you need me to update this in the future | N/A | 11-17-2022 |
| CyPwn Store | App to browse the CyPwn IPA Library, regular and TrollStore | [CyPwn IPA Library](https://ipa.cypwn.xyz) | 11-13-2022 |
| Dead Cells | [Game description here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dead-cells/id1389752090). Normally I don't upload games but this one was requested in a server. If you want me to update this, you'll have to ask when an update to the game releases | [AppDB](https://appdb.to/app/ios/1389752090) | 12-01-2022 |

| DPixelGPT | ChatGPT, without some of the UI glitches in the one I posted earlier, with a slightly more up-to-date ChatGPT. Create your own account. You only get a limited number of questions per hour, so using one account between multiple people will just be an inconvenience | [DPixel](https://t.me/dpixel) | 12-29-2022 |

| EhPanda | A strictly 18+ NSFW manga reader. *Newer releases support only iOS 15, and newest releases only support iOS 16, which is not compatible with TrollStore. If you are on iOS 15 and want to test a newer version of the app, you will have to do that on your own.* | [EhPanda-Team](https://github.com/EhPanda-Team/EhPanda) | 12-23-2022 |

| Enmity w/ Flowercord | Enmity with Flowercord. I took CyPwn's Enmity ipa and injected it with a Flowercord deb (huge thanks to rosie aka acquitelol for having a deb of Flowercord available). Flowercord gives you more squared profile pictures, and bubbles around chat messages, according to the ppl that tested the injected ipa for me. Not sure if I'll continue to release updates to this since I won't test it against future Enmity ipa releases myself. Use at your own discretion. If you installed this a second ago, I re-uploaded it with ScrollToTop, because it can't hurt to have that too. Enjoy! | N/A | 11-16-2022 |
| ESign | An app source browser that I personally use alongside TrollStore, that also occasionally gives you free certificates to sign apps with if you wish to traditionally sideload your apps. Can also inject debs into the IPA of your choice. | [CyPwn IPA Library](https://ipa.cypwn.xyz) / [AppDB](https://appdb.to/app/cydia/1900000897) | 11-28-2022 |

| Gangstar Vegas | [Gangstar Vegas](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gangstar-vegas-mafia-action/id571393580), with the following hacks: unlimited coins/ammo, no reload, no cops.

| Instagram Dark | Kinda like TikTokDark, but for Instagram. Features include media saving, profile picture saving, follow status, anonymous story viewing, etc. I mean, IG Rocket IPAs are very easy to find, but this one has a slightly better UI if you ask me | [CydiaAbdullah](https://t.me/CAbdullahiPA) | 12-27-2022 |
| Instagram LRD | *This is pretty much TrollStore-only, unless other sideloading software allows you to override current installs without uninstalling as well. If you're on TrollStore, first install and sign into Instagram from the App Store, then force overwrite it with this IPA. If you can't use TrollStore, sign into literally any other sideloaded Instagram IPA with the same bundleID (the default one), and then install this one. I can't guarantee that this will work if you're sideloading, but it's worth a shot. Otherwise, the app will crash on the login screen.* If you've used TikTokLRD, imagine that but for Instagram. Features include media saving/sharing/previewing (stories included), show follow status, disable typing status, view DMs anonymously, disable ads, FaceID for account switching, etc. | [IPA Fire](https://t.me/ipafire) | 12-27-2022 |
| InstaRocketPlus | Instagram, injected with Rocket *and* Plus for Instagram cracked. If you use the friendship status checker, enable the one from Rocket settings.

| InstaRocketPlusSquare | InstaRocketPlus, with InstagramSquareAvatars injected, on Instagram v249.0. I most ilkely won't be keeping this updated with newer versions of InstaRocketPlus. Thanks to sudo in CyPwn for the InstaRocketPlus ipa | N/A | 11-18-2022 | 
| InstaSpring | App that instantly respring your phone | [haxi0](https://github.com/haxi0/InstaSpring) | 11-12-2022 |
| iPoGo | *I have switched back to the jailbroken version of iPoGo, so I won't be testing if a new uploaded version works with TrollStore. If you notice an issue with this app, you will have to create an issue on the GitHub yourself.* Pokemon GO with a bunch of cheats, including joystick-to-walk, increased catch accuracy, sniping, teleporting, etc. USE RESPONSIBLY, OVERUSE CAN GET YOU BANNED | https://ipogo.app | 12-15-2022 |

| Kodi | Multi-featured media player/streamer. Version 18.9 is the last version that will work with TrollStore, so this app likely won't be updated past this version | [CyPwn IPA Library](https://ipa.cypwn.xyz) | 11-11-2022 |
| LocationSimulation (LocSim) | Location spoofer, not affiliated with udevs' locsim | [CyPwn IPA Library](https://ipa.cypwn.xyz) | 11-10-2022 |
| Manga | Simple manga reader, because you can never have too many manga readers. To change the language to English: TrollStore users can simply use Filza to delete the ar.lproj folder from the app's bundle folder via Filza (if you're unsure which one is the bundle folder, you can find it using Apps Manager); for those sideloading, extract the contents of the IPA, delete the ar.lproj folder, and repack it (if you don't know how to repack an extracted IPA, Google it, it's a fairly simple process). | [IPA Fire](https://t.me/ipafire) | 12-19-2022 |

Allows for saving pretty much all media by long-pressing on them. *Few things to note: If you're jailbroken, fully disable tweak injection into VSCO using Choicy.

If you need to sign in this way, create a backup of VSCO from the App Store using either Apps Manager or Crane, depending on if your phone is jailbroken or not, while signed in before installing this ipa through TrollStore. This version also does not include dark mode. All other features should be the same* | [ipahost](https://github.com/ipahost/Lion-for-VSCO) / [KZStore](https://kzstore.net/)* | 12-03-2022 |
