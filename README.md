# TrollStore-IPAs

## Add source to ESign/AltStore/SideStore: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swaggyP36000/TrollStore-IPAs/main/apps.json

*Huge thanks to [hieuddo](https://github.com/hieuddo) for their effort to get this up and running. There are still a few issues I've noticed with how the repo is updated. While this is a good companion to have, following up with this repo itself is currently the best way to catch up on all IPA releases.*

**Please include your device specs and app versions when reporting issues, otherwise I have even less idea of what the reason behind your issue is**

A collection of IPA files from many different sources, for TrollStore!

All credit to their respective maintainers, I simply gather and update all the IPAs I have in one place

All *future* app updates will contain some form of version numbers in the file names. If the versioning scheme for an app changes, it is because the dev/maintainer changed up their scheme

All files can be found in Releases, either by Ctrl + F searching, or looking at the table to see what date the latest version of an app was released, and finding the corresponding release with a matching date

Releases are made by the day - new day, new release. I make a release one day and edit it throughout the day with new or updated IPAs until the day ends, and then create a new release post by the day and just modify it. This keeps notification spam to a minimum but will mean you might want to wait until the day ends to go through a release to make sure all files are final, since I may make changes throughout the day. Everything is done in the CST time zone

*Since people see TrollStore in the title and immediately think all apps in here are TrollStore only, they aren't. A lot of apps in here will work just fine when sideloaded. However, since I am personally using these apps with TrollStore, I cannot guarantee that every app will work while properly sideloaded, nor will I offer any support if an app from this list doesn't work as intended when sideloaded*

**Note about the Version column:** sometimes it will just be the app base version, sometimes it will be [tweak version]-[app version]. This is subject to change on a per-app, per-update basis

| Crunchyroll | Crunchyroll, the app. Yes, just the app. No tweak, no crack, no ad-block, nothing - just a decrypted Crunchyroll app. Why, you ask? Because apparently it's not available in certain other countries and someone requested it, and it works decrypted so I figured I'd throw it on this list.

| DLTikTokLRD | *There is a chance this only works properly via TrollStore, otherwise you may run into the "unlicesned" error in the DLTikTok settings.* TikTok injected with *both* DLTikTok and TikTokLRD! Saving slideshow images without a watermark is broken. DLTikTok needs an update for this for newer versions of TikTok. For now, use the [TikPhoto shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/12002/) to save them without a watermark | 29.0.0 | [ØªØ·Ø¨ÙŠÙ‚Ø§Øª IPA ðŸŒ™](https://t.me/ipa_crack) / [MeemNon](https://twitter.com/MeemNon) | 04-13-2023 |

For the last iOS 14 compatible version of BHTwitter, grab it from the 02-11-2023 release.* Kinda like DLTikTok, for Twitter. Features include downloading videos, confirm follows & likes/unlikes, disabling typing indicator in DMs, browsing accounts that blocked you, remove ads, etc. *Update this from other sources at your own risk, it's a pain in the ass to get it working if a newer version gives you the "unlicensed" error.

| DPixelGPT | ChatGPT, without some of the UI glitches in the one I posted earlier, with a slightly more up-to-date ChatGPT. Create your own account. You only get a limited number of questions per hour, so using one account between multiple people will just be an inconvenience | 1.0 | [DPixel](https://t.me/dpixel) | 12-29-2022 |

| Enmity w/ Flowercord | Enmity with Flowercord. I took CyPwn's Enmity ipa and injected it with a Flowercord deb (huge thanks to rosie aka acquitelol for having a deb of Flowercord available). Flowercord gives you more squared profile pictures, and bubbles around chat messages, according to the ppl that tested the injected ipa for me. Not sure if I'll continue to release updates to this since I won't test it against future Enmity ipa releases myself. Use at your own discretion. If you installed this a second ago, I re-uploaded it with ScrollToTop, because it can't hurt to have that too. Enjoy! | 2.1.4-153.0 | N/A | 11-16-2022 |
| ESign | An app source browser that I personally use alongside TrollStore, that also occasionally gives you free certificates to sign apps with if you wish to traditionally sideload your apps.

| Instagram Dark | Kinda like TikTokDark, but for Instagram. Features include media saving, profile picture saving, follow status, anonymous story viewing, etc. I mean, IG Rocket IPAs are very easy to find, but this one has a slightly better UI if you ask me | 279.0 | [CydiaAbdullah](https://t.me/CAbdullahiPA) | 04-23-2023 |
| Instagram Elite | Instagram, injected with Rocket Cracked *and* DLInsta/ *DLInsta's media downloading is hit-and-miss depending on the post, so keep that disabled and use Rocket's media saving toggles. For all other settings, you can pick and choose which tweak you want to do what.

| Instagram LRD | *This is pretty much TrollStore-only, unless other sideloading software allows you to override current installs without uninstalling as well. If you're on TrollStore, first install and sign into Instagram from the App Store, then force overwrite it with this IPA. If you can't use TrollStore, sign into literally any other sideloaded Instagram IPA with the same bundleID (the default one), and then install this one. I can't guarantee that this will work if you're sideloading, but it's worth a shot. Otherwise, the app will crash on the login screen.* If you've used TikTokLRD, imagine that but for Instagram. Features include media saving/sharing/previewing (stories included), show follow status, disable typing status, view DMs anonymously, disable ads, FaceID for account switching, etc. | 250.0 | [IPA Fire](https://t.me/ipafire) | 12-27-2022 |

| Violet | *Another* strictly 18+ NSFW manga reader. App is a bit buggy - let it download the database, then close and reopen if it freezes. You will have to reopen the app after going into some sub-menus bc there's no way out of them (UI bugs). Supports iOS 14+ | 1.28.4 | [project-violet](https://github.com/project-violet/violet) | 04-08-2023 |

| VSCO Lion | VSCO, injected with the tweak Lion by Michael Lema. Allows for saving pretty much all media by long-pressing on them. *Few things to note: If you're jailbroken, fully disable tweak injection into VSCO using Choicy. Signing in through Apple and Google don't work (clicking Apple does nothing, clicking Google causes a crash). If you need to sign in this way, create a backup of VSCO from the App Store using either Apps Manager or Crane, depending on if your phone is jailbroken or not, while signed in before installing this ipa through TrollStore. This version also does not include dark mode. All other features should be the same* | 1.4-282.0 | [ipahost](https://github.com/ipahost/Lion-for-VSCO) / [KZStore](https://kzstore.net/)* | 12-03-2022 |

| YouTube Elite | *Sign-in fix does not work unless you install with TrollStore. No solution to that so far.* If I'm correctly understanding the description, this is YouTube with DLTube, YouTubeKiller, YouTube Reborn, YouPiP etc. injected *As uYou+ is having video/audio download errors (403), this is currently the best modded IPA for YouTube in existence. This also has multiple toggles in the YouTubeKiller, etc. sections that may fix Google sign-in errors* **Newer versions of this IPA do not include YTKillerPlus. You will have to use Elite v18.02.3 under the 01-24-2023 release if you want YTKillerPlus** | 18.27.3 | [iPAWiND](https://t.me/iPAWiND) / [DarkWebUser](https://www.darkwebuser.com/) / [MeemNon](https://twitter.com/MeemNon) / [zxcvbn's tweaked IPAs](https://t.me/zxcvbn_tweaked) | 07-11-2023 |
