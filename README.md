# TrollStore-IPAs
A collection of IPA files from many different sources, for TrollStore!

All credit to their respective maintainers, I simply gather and update all the IPAs I have in one place

All *future* app updates will contain some form of version numbers in the file names. If the versioning scheme for an app changes, it is because the dev/maintainer changed up their scheme

All files can be found in Releases, either by Ctrl + F searching, or looking at the table to see what date the latest version of an app was released, and finding the corresponding release with a matching date

Releases are made by the day - new day, new release. I make a release one day and edit it throughout the day with new or updated IPAs until the day ends, and then create a new release post by the day and just modify it. This keeps notification spam to a minimum but will mean you might want to wait until the day ends to go through a release to make sure all files are final, since I may make changes throughout the day. Everything is done in the CST time zone

*Since people see TrollStore in the title and immediately think all apps in here are TrollStore only, they aren't. A lot of apps in here will work just fine when sideloaded. However, since I am personally using these apps with TrollStore, I cannot guarantee that every app will work while properly sideloaded, nor will I offer any support if an app from this list doesn't work as intended when sideloaded*

Everything you can currently find in this repo:

|----------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Aidoku | Webtoon/manga browser | https://aidoku.app | 10-22-2022 |
| AirTroller | *Since spammers like this are popular, and I already expect multiple people to ask me this question, no, this will not work if you sideload it. You need to install via TrollStore. There is a fork for iOS 12 users [here](https://github.com/haxi0/AirTroller12).* That being said, enjoy the reincarnation of TrollDrop! | [sourcelocation](https://github.com/sourcelocation/AirTroller) | 11-27-2022 |

| BeRealUnblur | BeReal, injected with the tweak BeRealUnblur | [u/LOST_iPhone_btw](https://www.reddit.com/r/sideloaded/comments/ypwu9z/release_bereal_with_berealunblur/) | 11-10-2022 |
| BHTwitter | Twitter, with added features such as custom fonts, video saving, no ads, tabs customization, and more! *For people who aren't using TrollStore, use the non-TS IPA from BandarHL's GitHub* | [BandarHL](https://github.com/BandarHL/BHTwitter) / [AppDB](https://appdb.to/app/cydia/333903828) | 11-25-2022 |

| Crunchyroll | Crunchyroll, the app. Yes, just the app. No tweak, no crack, no ad-block, nothing - just a decrypted Crunchyroll app. Why, you ask? Because apparently it's not available in certain other countries and someone requested it, and it works decrypted so I figured I'd throw it on this list. Will probably only update this on request, so create an issue if you need me to update this in the future | N/A | 11-17-2022 |
| CyPwn Store | App to browse the CyPwn IPA Library, regular and TrollStore | [CyPwn IPA Library](https://ipa.cypwn.xyz) | 11-13-2022 |

| Enmity w/ Flowercord | Enmity with Flowercord. I took CyPwn's Enmity ipa and injected it with a Flowercord deb (huge thanks to rosie aka acquitelol for having a deb of Flowercord available). Flowercord gives you more squared profile pictures, and bubbles around chat messages, according to the ppl that tested the injected ipa for me. Not sure if I'll continue to release updates to this since I won't test it against future Enmity ipa releases myself. Use at your own discretion. If you installed this a second ago, I re-uploaded it with ScrollToTop, because it can't hurt to have that too. Enjoy! | N/A | 11-16-2022 |

Allows for saving pretty much all media by long-pressing on them. *Few things to note: If you're jailbroken, fully disable tweak injection into VSCO using Choicy.
