# TrollStore-IPAs
A collection of IPA files from many different sources, for TrollStore!

All credit to their respective maintainers, I simply gather and update all the IPAs I have in one place

All *future* app updates will contain some form of version numbers in the file names. If the versioning scheme for an app changes, it is because the dev/maintainer changed up their scheme

All files can be found in Releases, either by Ctrl + F searching, or looking at the table to see what date the latest version of an app was released, and finding the corresponding release with a matching date

Releases are made by the day - new day, new release. I make a release one day and edit it throughout the day with new or updated IPAs until the day ends, and then create a new release post by the day and just modify it. This keeps notification spam to a minimum but will mean you might want to wait until the day ends to go through a release to make sure all files are final, since I may make changes throughout the day. Everything is done in the CST time zone
